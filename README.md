# Inventory App


Summary:
  The Inventory App for Android is a demo project for Udacity Android Basics Nanodegree. It stores a list of different products held in an inventory, including a picture of the product. There is also a button which launches an email client to order more product from suppliers. One could benefit from using this app because of its camera function and email function, keeping track of inventory with a visual aid and providing a direct means of communicating with supply vendors.
